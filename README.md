# Project Abstract: 
Stock Market Prices are highly volatile, affected by multiple factors stemming from internal company matters/decisions or external market forces and overall investors' sentiments. With the introduction of technological breakthroughs such as global digitalization, stock market forecasting has entered a technologically enhanced era, reviving the traditional trading methodology. The application of advanced Machine Learning techniques has improved the prediction accuracy of stock prices. However, due to non-linear, irregular, and chaotic data, stock market analysis and prediction remain some of the most challenging research areas. This project tries to achieve the task of stock price prediction on the basis of machine learning algorithms: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Moving Average, Linear Regression, Exponential Moving Average. The data of the companies ‘Vodafone-Idea Limited’, ‘Axis Bank Limited’ and 'Asian paints Limited’ for the years 2015-2020 have been critically analyzed under the framework of these algorithms. Furthermore, the models were evaluated on the basis of Root-Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values.
